# Perfect Paper Password for PHP

This is implementation of [Steve Gibson's Perfect Paper Password](https://www.grc.com/ppp), but in PHP. This was heavily inspired by [Bob Somers](http://www.bobsomers.com/2007/11/03/ppp-in-php/) implementation, but this is re-worked slightly. There's also a PPPv3 implementation

This is all super old code and I forgot we even wrote it. Use it freely, with attribution.

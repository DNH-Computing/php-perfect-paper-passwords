<h1>PPP in PHP (November 2, 2007)</h1>
<p>An implementation of the PPP CryptoSystem designed by Steve Gibson of GRC<br />
Full details and spec can be found at <a href="http://www.grc.com/ppp">http://www.grc.com/ppp</a></p>
<p>Implementation in PHP by <a href="http://www.bobsomers.com">Bob Somers</a><br />
Tested on PHP version 5.2.3</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>PHP5, preferably 5.2.3 or higher (that's what I tested with)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.hash.php">hash()</a> function must support the SHA256 hash. You can check this with the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.hash-algos.php">hash_algos()</a> function.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.bc.php">bcmath extension</a> for dealing with numbers of arbitrary size.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mcrypt.php">mcrypt extension</a> (built against libmcrypt > 2.4.x) for 128-bit Rijndael.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important:</h2>
<p>This is not a complete authentication system, it's merely a library that implements the important PPP
functionality. It's stil up to you to work this into your authentication system in a meaningful way.
Keep checking my website (<a href="http://www.bobsomers.com">bobsomers.com</a>) though because I'm working on some samples of how to integrate
this into a complete authentication system. Those samples will be packaged with this library for the next
release.</p>

<h2>A Note About bcmath:</h2>
<p>You'll notice that certain functions require the numbers you pass to be "arbitrary-length decimal strings".
All that means is that numbers that are larger than the maxmium value of a 32-bit signed integer should be
passed as a string. If you use the bcmath functions to calculate these numbers than you're dealing with
arbitrary-length decimal strings already. As long as the value is below the 32-bit signed integer limit,
however, you can just pass the integer value itself and PHP will handle the type conversion automatically.</p>
	
<h2>Performance:</h2>
<p>On my system, which runs an Intel E6750 Core 2 Duo (2.66 Ghz) I can generate and verify roughly 3000 passcodes
per second (from the same sequence key). Keep in mind that this implementation is far more computationally
expensive than a much slimmer implementation, in say, C, since numbers have to be manipulated as binary or
hex strings using substring extractions instead of bit shifting. This is due to the fact that PHP only stores
integers in 32-bit signed notation (at noted above). However, it's not computationally prohibitive, and as
long as you're running it on a decently powered machine (for those who require heavy usage) you'll be just fine.</p>
	
<h2>Function Documentation:</h2>
<h3>GenerateSequenceKeyFromString($passphrase)</h3>
<ul>
<li>$passphrase is a string, like "zombie"</li>
<li>returns a hex string that contains your 256-bit sequence key</li>
<p>Please note that using this method to generate your sequence keys is not recommended, as it is not as secure
as generating a unique, random key for each person and saving that.</p>
<h4>EXAMPLE USAGE:</h4>
<pre>$key = GenerateSequenceKeyFromString("zombie");
echo "The key is $key\n";</pre>
<h4>EXAMPLE OUTPUT:</h4>
<pre>The key is 49460b7bbbd3aad3f2cba09864f5e8b01a220ea8c077e9fa996de367e7984af0</pre>
</ul>

<h3>GenerateRandomSequenceKey()</h3>
<ul>
<li>returns a hex string that contains your 256-bit sequence key</li>
<p>Hashes a combination of your system's hostname details, the PHP script memory usage, a list of your installed
PHP extensions, and several samplings of the system microtime to generate a random sequence key.</p>
<h4>EXAMPLE USAGE:</h4>
<pre>$key = GenerateRandomSequenceKey();
echo "The key is $key\n";</pre>
<h4>EXAMPLE OUTPUT: (Yours will be different!)</h4>
<pre>The key is 8566a0b989e04c63746b17836dd1325b8fb7c1cc9fb61e6338c9528939311c69</pre>
</ul>
			
<h3>RetrievePasscodes($first, $count, $sequence_key)</h3>
<ul>
<li>$first is number of the first passcode you'd like to get, note that passcodes are numbered starting at 0</li>
<li>$count is how many passcodes you'd like returned</li>
<li>both $first and $count should be passed as arbitrary-length decimal strings if they are larger than the 32-bit signed integer limit</li>
<li>$sequence_key is a hex string containing the sequence key that should be used to generate the passcodes</li>
<li>returns an array (zero-based) of $count passcodes, in order</li>
<p>This will hand back an array of passcodes starting with a particular numbered passcode in the sequence. Keep
in mind that the passcode number is a decimal number, like "passcode 59", not the number as seen on a passcard,
like "3A on passcard 2".</p>
<h4>EXAMPLE USAGE:</h4>
<pre>// i'm using a string here so that the example output will match yours
// in the real world, you would want to use GenerateRandomSequenceKey() instead
$key = GenerateSequenceKeyFromString("zombie");
$passcodes = RetrievePasscodes(0, 8, $key); // get the first 8 passcodes
print_r($passcodes);</pre>
<h4>EXAMPLE OUTPUT:</h4>
<pre>Array
(
	[0] => 8N=3
	[1] => 7ucE
	[2] => aAg3
	[3] => zVv#
	[4] => y2Fm
	[5] => nGc8
	[6] => Vad=
	[7] => #V5p
)</pre>
